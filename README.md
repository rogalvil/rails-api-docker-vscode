## IMPORTANT: RUN THIS AFTER CREATING THE REPO FROM THE TEMPLATE!!!

Once you've created this repository from the
['rogalvil/rails-api-docker-vscode'](https://github.com/rogalvil/rails-api-docker-vscode)
template, please run this script inside Visual Studio Code Dev Container - or if
you have rails installed in the host, you can do it directly:

```bash
bin/run-after-repo-create-from-template
```

You should delete this section of the `README.md` file after successfully
running this command.

Create a commit with these changes, and push it to `main`.

A `config/master.key` file should be created in the process. Make sure you store
the contents of this file in a safe place, as it is used to encrypt and decrypt.
